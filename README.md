# Luminary-Apparel system

# Project Background
We decided on the garment sector as the target market for our work. The clothing industry's "Luminary Apparel (Pvt) Ltd" is where we plan to develop a system.  It is situated in Homagama, Colombo, on Avissawella Road. It is a medium-sized industry for clothing. The production manager, the quality control manager, the merchandiser, the pattern maker, the sample maker, the sewing supervisor, the sewing machine operator, the cutter, the trimmer, the ironer/presser, the packaging and shipping coordinator, and the cleaner are all present.
We used questionnaires, document analysis, and interviews to gather data from the manager, staff, and employees when we originally built and studied this system. That helped us understand the workings of the Luminary Apparel Garment System. 

# Business Objectives
It is evident from the data we gather that the main focus of our project is on managing employee-related duties and guaranteeing correct and timely remuneration. This is in line with the functionality of a payroll system, which was developed expressly to handle tasks concerning salaries, deductions, and payments for employees. Therefore, the payroll system we are implementing would be regarded as an HCM system (Human Capital Management). It is an essential component of HR operations and supports the entire functioning of the company.   The primary objectives of this project are to create tools for creating reports, tracking employee arrival times, and managing employee payroll for the apparel industry.
